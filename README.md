Debian NVIDIA driver installer
===============================
Debian is a popular Linux distro, however I have found installing Nvidia non-free drivers is a bit confusing and doesn't always work right.

This is a script that will allow you to install/uninstall Nvidia drivers in 
Debian **jessie** / **wheezy** / **squeeze** or whatever version you want, the easy way.

##Instalation
```php
chmod +x *.sh
```

##Usage
Install drivers:

```bash
./install-nvidia-drivers.sh wheezy
```

Remove drivers:

```bash
./remove-nvidia-drivers.sh
```
